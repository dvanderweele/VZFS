This is a hierarchical filesystem emulation Javascript library that uses IndexedDB in web browsers. It has a simple, minimalistic set of essential features to empower your application. In addition to file and folder CRUD operations, it supports multiple named filesystems within your same origin, with the ability to import and export backup copies of individual filesystems as JSON!
